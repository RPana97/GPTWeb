Explanation

    Header: Contains the main title of the webpage.
    Navigation Bar: Includes three links for "Dolphins," "Whales," and "Seals," which correspond to different sections on the page.
    Main Content Area: Contains three sections with images and descriptions of dolphins, whales, and seals.
    Footer: Displays copyright information and contact details.
    External CSS: The CSS file (styles.css) styles the webpage to be visually appealing and responsive. It includes media queries to ensure the navigation bar adjusts for smaller screens.

To complete this project, place index.html and styles.css in the same directory, and ensure you have images named dolphins.jpg, whales.jpg, and seals.jpg in the same directory or update the paths in the HTML accordingly.

I added in the jpgs into the directory to show on the website.
